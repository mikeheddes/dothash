# DotHash: Estimating Set Similarity Metrics for Link Prediction and Document Deduplication

This repository contains the source code for the research paper published at Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Conference (KDD) 2023.


## Requirements

The code is written in Python 3.10. The required packages to run the experiments can be found in `requirements.txt`. To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experiments

The experiments are divided into two parts: (1) link prediction and (2) document deduplication. The experiments can be run using the following commands:

### Link Prediction

```bash
python link_prediction.py --help
```

### Document Deduplication

```bash 
python document_deduplication.py --help
```
